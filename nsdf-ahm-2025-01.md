<h3> Fifth National Science Data Fabric (NSDF) <br>All-Hands Meeting“Broadening Engagement in Science” <br> San Diego, CA on May 5 - 7, 2025</h3>
</center>




The [National Science Data Fabric](https://nationalsciencedatafabric.org) (NSDF) is an NSF-supported pilot that connects an open network of institutions, including minority-serving institutions, by constructing a continuous integration platform for equitable data use and data-driven sciences. 

For the fifth NSDF All-Hands Meeting, we gather new and existing members of the NSDF community in San Diego, CA to address challenges of data democratization. This year's theme will be **“Broadening Engagement in Science,”** and we will meet from May 5-7, 2025.

<h3>Bio</h3>


Miron Livny received a B.Sc. degree in Physics and Mathematics in 1975 from the Hebrew University and M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from the Weizmann Institute of Science in 1978 and 1984, respectively. Since 1983 he has been on the Computer Sciences Department faculty at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he is currently the John P. Morgridge Professor of Computer Science and a Vilas Research Professor. He serves as the director of the Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC), is leading the HTCondor Software Suite effort and serves as the technical director of the OSG. He is a member of the scientific leadership team of the Morgridge Institute of Research where he leads the Research Computing theme.

Dr. Livny's research focuses on distributed processing and object management systems and involves close collaboration with researchers from a wide spectrum of disciplines. He pioneered the area of High Throughput Computing (HTC) and developed frameworks and software tools that have been widely adopted by academic, government and commercial organizations around the world. 

Livny is the recipient of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD Test of Time Award the 2013 HPDC Achievement Award the 2020 IEEE TCDP Outstanding Technical Achievement Award, 2020 IEEE TCDP High Impact Paper Award and the 2023 UW-Madison Vilas Research Professor award. 

# KEYNOTE

Keynote Speaker: **Ryan Coffee**

Title: *Information Ecosystems from Sensor to NSDF*

<p align=center>
<img src="assets/images/ryan.jpg" width="70%" style="filter: drop-shadow(5px 5px 5px #222);"> 
</p>


<h3>Abstract</h3>
Coming soon…

<h3>Bio</h3>

Ryan earned his Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy and Bachelor of Science in Physics from the University of Arkansas followed by a PhD in Atomic, Molecular and Optical (AMO) Physics from the University of Connecticut. He joined the PULSE Institute at Stanford/SLAC in 2006 and led the first laser pumped, x-ray probed experiment at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) in 2009. Since then, he has become Senior Research Scientist in PULSE and LCLS with an emphasis on AMO science and novel instrumentation and the requisite computational methods for streaming data processing at the sensor edge, in particular targeting the million frames per second LCLS-II.

In that context he has been a core member of the SLAC AI Initiative since its inception with particular emphasis on Machine Learning for real-time information extraction. With projects ranging from x-ray spectroscopy in molecules, ultrafast materials response, radiographic medical imaging, and tokamak plasma fusion, he has become an adamant proponent of data and model marketplaces for cross-domain innovation sharing with built in provenance and value tracking for an intelligent adaptive data and model retention.

Beyond SLAC, Ryan is driving an integrative approach to instrumentation and co-design of computing infrastructure across the portfolio of Department of Energy labs and facilities as well as technologies across the computing industry. From diagnostic and detector development to algorithms and AI accelerators, from the sensor Edge to Leadership Computing Facilities, he is leveraging his hobbies and his passions to drive the bleeding edge of basic science to address the emerging challenges of automation in industry and agriculture for a better future for his daughters.

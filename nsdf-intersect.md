# NSDF and INTERSECT Showcase Breakthrough in AI-Guided Autonomous Experiments
## Commissioning On-the-Fly Science: Runtime Steering and AI Integration Pinpoint Spin Flop Transitions in Œ±-Fe‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ

On June 4, 2025, the National Science Data Fabric (NSDF) and Oak Ridge National Laboratory‚Äôs INTERSECT program successfully hosted a joint debrief meeting to highlight the **breakthrough in AI-guided autonomous experiments** integrating runtime steering and artificial intelligence (AI) for real-time scientific discovery. 

The team demonstrated how these capabilities enabled the precise identification of spin flop transitions in hematite (Œ±-Fe‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ), paving the way for smarter, faster experimentation across DOE facilities.

## About the Experiment
Since January 13, 2025, the NSDF team has partnered with Marshall McDonnell, lead scientist of ORNL‚Äôs Autonomous Neutron Diffraction team within INTERSECT, to run an autonomous experiment targeting spin flop transitions in Œ±-Fe‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ (hematite).

This collaboration integrated NSDF‚Äôs domain-agnostic infrastructure with INTERSECT‚Äôs neutron beamline, enabling:
- Real-time data steering via AI-driven dashboards
- NSDF-backed storage and data services
- A custom end-to-end experimental workflow

The result: a successful on-the-fly experiment demonstrating the power of AI-guided discovery at national user facilities.

## Milestone Success

The teams conducted an autonomous experiment targeting a **spin flop transition in ùõº-Fe‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ at 260K**, guided by prior NOMAD data and literature.

> ‚ÄúThis experiment marks a breakthrough in autonomous experimentation,‚Äù said Marshall McDonnell (ORNL).

The collaboration also sparked interdisciplinary excitement:

> ‚ÄúIt was very exciting to learn about a different field and see how we can help other domains,‚Äù said Jack Marquez (NSDF). ‚ÄúI was thrilled to be in the control room.‚Äù


## Next Steps
Energized by this experiment's success, the collaboration is moving forward with a second autonomous experiment in August 2025, leveraging ORNL‚Äôs high-resolution Powder Diffractometer (POWGEN) to investigate phase transitions in iron oxide.

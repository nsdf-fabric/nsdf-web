The 28th International Conference on *Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention* (MICCAI 2025 [1,2]) hosted **Valerio Pascucci** in Daejeon, Republic of Korea.

The tutorial focused on practical medical imaging applications of federated learning (FL) through its sessions, covering topics such as the MLCommons, NVFlare, MedPerf demonstrations, and various medical imaging FL applications.

**Pascucci** delivered a tutorial presentation titled *"Clinical Translation of Federated Learning with Regulatory Oversight,"* demonstrating the ability to connect advanced machine learning methods to clinical practice while following regulatory requirements [3]. 

The tutorial provides **essential educational value to researchers and practitioners who study artificial intelligence in medical imaging**.

The [National Science Data Fabric](https://nationalsciencedatafabric.org/) (NSDF) is proud to announce its 2024 cohort of NSDF Fellows, awarding travel grants to fifteen outstanding individuals, more than doubling last year’s count of seven. Selected from a highly competitive pool of applicants, this diverse group of fellows—including students, early career researchers, and faculty from Minority Serving Institutions across the country—will join the SC24 community in Atlanta, November 17-22, participating in activities and learning opportunities as a connected cohort. In addition, each fellow will receive a membership to ACM’s SIGHPC, the leading high-performance computing professional society, and attend the SIGHPC annual meeting in Atlanta.

Several fellows will attend SC24 for the first time. All will engage in NSDF-sponsored sessions, including the EduHPC-24 workshop and the panel “Creating Inclusive Scientific Communities in the Information Age: Can Equity Democratize Data-Intensive Research?”

*“We are excited to support this exceptional group of NSDF Fellows at SC24,”* says Michela Taufer, NSDF co-PI and Dongarra Professor of High Performance Computing at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. *“This fellowship reflects our commitment to democratizing data delivery by fostering a more inclusive, engaged, and well-prepared community in high-performance computing (HPC). The fellows will have the unique opportunity to gain insights from experts, connect with peers, and return with new ideas that can transform their research and communities.”*

Valerio Pascucci, NSDF PI and Professor of Computer Science at the University of Utah, adds, *“NSDF is dedicated to advancing equitable access to scientific data and infrastructure, and this fellowship program helps cultivate leaders who share this vision. Our collaborations, enriched by the perspectives of our fellows, help us collectively tackle some of the biggest challenges in data access and democratization.”*

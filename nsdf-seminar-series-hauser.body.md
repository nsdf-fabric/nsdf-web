**Abstract:** The NSF NCAR Computational & Information Systems Lab (CISL) provides research computing and data services to the Earth System Science community. This talk will highlight CISL's role in advancing scientific discovery by delivering high-performance computing environments, managing data repositories, and developing innovative computational and data science tools. In addition to HPC systems, CISL offers a wide range of data services, which provides access to petabytes of curated Earth science datasets. Through ongoing efforts in data assimilation, machine learning, and visualization, CISL provides researchers with tools to extract insights from the vast amounts of data generated by observations and simulations. This talk will discuss CISL's computing and data services and plans for updating the infrastructure to address the challenges of data-intensive workflows.

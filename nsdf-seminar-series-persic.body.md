**Abstract:** The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) led a consultative and collaborative process to develop an international standard-setting instrument on open science in the form of a UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science, which was adopted by 193 counties in November 2021. This talk will highlight the components of the Recommendation, including key definitions, values and guiding principles, and areas of action. With the advent in the US of the Nelson memo and OSTP naming 2023 as the year of open science, it is timely to refer to UNESCO's efforts which also include an open science toolkit and checklists to support the implementation of open science worldwide.

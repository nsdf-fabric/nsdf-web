abstract = {The lack of a readily accessible, tightly integrated data fabric connecting high-speed networking, storage, and computing services remains a critical barrier to the democratization of scientific discovery. To address this challenge, we are building National Science Data Fabric (NSDF), a holistic ecosystem to facilitate domain scientists in their daily research. NSDF comprises networking, storage, and computing services, as well as outreach initiatives. In this paper, we present a testbed integrating three services (i.e., networking, storage, and computing). We evaluate their performance. Specifically, we study the networking services and their throughput and latency with a focus on academic cloud providers; the storage services and their performance with a focus on data movement using file system mappers for both academic and commercial clouds; and computing orchestration services focusing on commercial cloud providers. We discuss NSDF's potential to increase scalability and usability as it decreases time-to-discovery across scientific domains.},

abstract="As researchers across scientific domains rapidly adopt advanced scientific computing methodologies, access to advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI) becomes a critical requirement in scientific discovery. Lowering the entry barriers to CI is a crucial challenge in interdisciplinary sciences requiring frictionless software integration, data sharing from many distributed sites, and access to heterogeneous computing platforms. In this paper, we explore how the challenge is not merely a factor of availability and affordability of computing, network, and storage technologies but rather the result of insufficient interfaces with an increasingly heterogeneous mix of computing technologies and data sources. With more distributed computation and data, scientists, educators, and students must invest their time and effort in coordinating data access and movements, often penalizing their scientific research. Investments in the interfaces' software stack are necessary to help scientists, educators, and students across domains take advantage of advanced computational methods. To this end, we propose developing a science data fabric as the standard scientific discovery interface that seamlessly manages data dependencies within scientific workflows and CI.",

abstract = {In the era of big data, materials science workflows need to handle large-scale data distribution, storage, and computation. Any of these areas can become a performance bottleneck. We present a framework for analyzing internal material structures (e.g., cracks) to mitigate these bottlenecks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for a workflow performing synchrotron X-ray computed tomography reconstruction and segmentation of a silica-based structure. Our framework provides a cloud-based, cutting-edge solution to challenges such as growing intermediate and output data and heavy resource demands during image reconstruction and segmentation. Specifically, our framework efficiently manages data storage, scaling up compute resources on the cloud. The multi-layer software structure of our framework includes three layers. A top layer uses Jupyter notebooks and serves as the user interface. A middle layer uses Ansible for resource deployment and managing the execution environment. A low layer is dedicated to resource management and provides resource management and job scheduling on heterogeneous nodes (i.e., GPU and CPU). At the core of this layer, Kubernetes supports resource management, and Dask enables large-scale job scheduling for heterogeneous resources. The broader impact of our work is four-fold: through our framework, we hide the complexity of the cloud’s software stack to the user who otherwise is required to have expertise in cloud technologies; we manage job scheduling efficiently and in a scalable manner; we enable resource elasticity and workflow orchestration at a large scale; and we facilitate moving the study of nonporous structures, which has wide applications in engineering and scientific fields, to the cloud. While we demonstrate the capability of our framework for a specific materials science application, it can be adapted for other applications and domains because of its modular, multi-layer architecture.},

abstract = {In MPI, collective routines MPI_Alltoall and MPI_Alltoallv play an important role in facilitating all-to-all inter-process data exchange. MPI_Alltoallv is a generalization of MPI_Alltoall, supporting the exchange of non-uniform distributions of data. Popular implementations of MPI, such as MPICH and OpenMPI, implement MPI_Alltoall using a combination of techniques such as the Spread-out algorithm and the Bruck algorithm. Spread-out has a linear complexity in P, compared to Bruck's logarithmic complexity (P: process count); a selection between these two techniques is made at runtime based on the data block size. However, MPI_Alltoallv is typically implemented using only variants of the spread-out algorithm, and therefore misses out on the performance benefits that the log-time Bruck algorithm offers (especially for smaller data loads).In this paper, we first implement and empirically evaluate all existing variants of the Bruck algorithm for uniform and non-uniform data loads-this forms the basis for our own Bruck-based non-uniform all-to-all algorithms. In particular, we developed two open-source implementations, padded Bruck and two-phase Bruck, that efficiently generalize Bruck algorithm to non-uniform all-to-all data exchange. We empirically validate the techniques on three supercomputers: Theta, Cori, and Stampede, using both microbenchmarks and two real-world applications: graph mining and program analysis. We perform weak and strong scaling studies for a range of average message sizes, degrees of imbalance, and distribution schemes, and demonstrate that our techniques outperform vendor-optimized Cray's MPI_Alltoallv by as much as 50\% for some workloads and scales.},

Both academic and commercial cloud offerings exist, but no single standardized interface for common actions such as configuration, launching, and termination of virtual resources exists. This imposes huge technical burden on domain scientist that attempt to take advantage of these resources; even expert users spend considerable time to port their applications from one cloud platform to another.With this work, we make available to the community a unified API toolkit as well as five in-depth reports on challenges we encountered working with different academic and commercial cloud providers. Our toolkit implements automations for common tasks such as simultaneous launching and termination of large numbers of virtual machines (VM) across the cloud. We demonstrate that our toolkit brings down the time users need to spend launching and terminating these resources to mere minutes, thus enabling ad-hoc multi-cloud clusters.},

abstract = {Abstract Single particle tracking (SPT) of fluorescent molecules provides significant insights into the diffusion and relative motion of tagged proteins and other structures of interest in biology. However, despite the latest advances in high-resolution microscopy, individual particles are typically not distinguished from clusters of particles. This lack of resolution obscures potential evidence for how merging and splitting of particles affect their diffusion and any implications on the biological environment. The particle tracks are typically decomposed into individual segments at observed merge and split events, and analysis is performed without knowing the true count of particles in the resulting segments. Here, we address the challenges in analyzing particle tracks in the context of cancer biology. In particular, we study the tracks of KRAS protein, which is implicated in nearly 20\% of all human cancers, and whose clustering and aggregation have been linked to the signaling pathway leading to uncontrolled cell growth. We present a new analysis approach for particle tracks by representing them as tracking graphs and using topological events – merging and splitting, to disambiguate the tracks. Using this analysis, we infer a lower bound on the count of particles as they cluster and create conditional distributions of diffusion speeds before and after merge and split events. Using thousands of time-steps of simulated and in-vitro SPT data, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method, as it offers the biologists a new, detailed look into the relationship between KRAS clustering and diffusion speeds.},

abstract = {Computational resources are increasingly provisioned to users through cloud-like interfaces. Both academic and commercial cloud offerings exist, but no single standardized interface for common actions such as configuration, launching, and termination of virtual resources exists. This imposes huge technical burden on domain scientist that attempt to take advantage of these resources; even expert users spend considerable time to port their applications from one cloud platform to another.With this work, we make available to the community a unified API toolkit as well as five in-depth reports on challenges we encountered working with different academic and commercial cloud providers. Our toolkit implements automations for common tasks such as simultaneous launching and termination of large numbers of virtual machines (VM) across the cloud. We demonstrate that our toolkit brings down the time users need to spend launching and terminating these resources to mere minutes, thus enabling ad-hoc multi-cloud clusters.},
